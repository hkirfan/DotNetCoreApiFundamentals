# DotNetCoreApiFundamentals
This project demonstrates how to build APIs using .NET Core MVC. The project focuses on implementing RESTFUL APIs with a pragmatic approach in order to have better maintainability and ease of use. API calls have been designed for various HTTP verbs and tested them through Postman. 

The project also makes use of data from a local SQLDB implemented using EntityFramework Core for responding to API calls and also validates it for every GET/POST calls. Association and Functional APIs have also been implemented to examine their usage. Finally, the project is modeled to suport versioning via Header or QueryStrings.
